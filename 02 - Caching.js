 * Lesson 02 - Caching
 * 
 * To implement a cache, we need to add a layer of abstraction
 * between the resolver and the database request.
 * 
 * That "cache layer" is responsible for deciding whether
 * a request actually queries the database or just returns
 * a cached value.
 * 
 * Lets create an object named "cache" with a method named load
 * and copy/paste the database request from the author resolver
 * 
 * Then the author resolver can call cache.load with the author_id
 * and everything should work just like it did before
 * 
 * We can send the same request multiple times and it still hits the
 * database every time.
 * 
 * We'll give the cache a "promises" object that will work like a Map or Dictionary
 * The keys in the object are the user IDs we've tried to load, and the values
 * are the database request for that user ID
 * 
 * So we can guard this function with a check to see if promises object
 * already contains this key, and if so, return the promise from the cache
 * 
 * If it doesn't, then we add the database request to the cache
 * and return it
 * 
 * Just to make it easier to see what's going on, we'll add a console.log
 * Cache hit for "key"
 * 
 * If we query the posts now, we can see that every user that
 * was called more than once, responds first from the database,
 * and then from the cache.
 * 
 * That's users 1, 2, and 4; and no database entry is called twice. That's good!
 * 
 * If we send a second request, every user is served from the cache
 * and will continue to be until the server restarts. 
 * 
 * That's bad â€“ But we'll fix that shortly
 *
