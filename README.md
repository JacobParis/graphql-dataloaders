## Running a database

This repo uses Docker Compose to initialize the PostGres database backing the application

To start the database, run

```sh
npm start
```

## Running each lesson

If you're working through the lessons, start with index.js

```sh
node index.js
```

To play a specific lesson, run it individually

```sh
node "08 - DataLoader.js"
```
