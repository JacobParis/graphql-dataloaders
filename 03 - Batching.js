/**
 * Lesson 03 - Batching
 * 
 * Batching is a second layer of abstraction
 * where instead of resolving requests immediately, we pause for a bit
 * 
 * And then we take every ID that was requested over that pause
 * and do one single query for all of them
 * 
 * Lets call that "activeQuery" and make it null by default.
 * 
 * To pause, we need to make a new Promise with a short timeout
 * 1 millisecond is ok here. Longer will allow bigger batches
 * but it will also make the requests slower.
 * 
 * Our batch size will be every ID in the promises cache, which 
 * gets us everything requested so far
 * 
 * Bring the database query code here, and we'll tweak it to accept
 * a list of IDs instead of just a single one
 * 
 * That's going to be Select all from users where id in "ids"
 * 
 * .where becomes .whereIn, and pass it all the IDs from the promiseCache
 * 
 * We don't just want the first item anymore, so we can remove .first()
 * and this becomes the activeQuery instead
 * 
 * If we're fetching the list of IDs from the cache, then we're going to
 * be missing the current one if it's not a cache hit. Lots of ways to
 * fix that, I'll just add it to the cache and be done with it
 * 
 * So the promise for each item key is going to start with the common
 * activeQuery (which returns every item in this batch) and then branch
 * off to find and return the specific ID for this item
 * 
 * Now we resolve the promise for this key, which is being returned
 * from the load method for this key.
 * 
 * Last thing â€“ once this batch has started, we don't need to dispatch it again
 * so only do that if we haven't set activeQuery yet
 * 
 * Lets test this out
 * 
 * One request for posts, and one request for all of the users at once. Before,
 * 1000 posts would do 1000 individual author requests. Now it will be 1 request
 * no matter how many posts we have
 * 
 * Running this a second time shows our cache still works across multiple network requests
 * 
 * Since there's no guarantee those requests come from the same person,
 * That means a logged-in user could cache some sensitive data that guest
 * users could access by mistake
