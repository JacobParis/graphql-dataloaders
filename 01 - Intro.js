/**
 * Lesson 01 - Individual requests for each item
 * 
 * This is an Apollo GraphQL application with a PostGRES database
 * that contains a table of posts and a table of users
 *  
 * We have a posts query that returns an array of Posts
 * And a users query that returns an array of Users
 * 
 * Lets query the posts, and we can see every item
 * in the database is returned
 * 
    query {
      posts {
        id
        title
      }
    }
 *
 * And the users query does the same for the users
 * 
    query {
      users {
        id
        name
      }
    }
 * 
 * So what we're looking to accomplish here is to
 * extend the Post query to also return the user
 * who wrote the post
 * 
 * We can start by adding a new field to the schema
 * named author with a return type of User 
 * 
 * Then if we scroll down to the resolvers section
 * for the "Post" type and add an "author" field
 * 
 * We'll return a list of "users" where the id matches the post's "author_id"
 * and since we only want one, grab the first one from the array
 *
 * Lets try that request out, with the author, ID, and name
 * 
    query {
      posts {
        id
        title
        author {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    }
 * 
 * And we get all the author information for each post
 * 
 * It's a little hard to tell what the database is actually doing here
 * So we'll add some console logs to track how many times
 * we're interacting with the database
 * 
 * Under "posts", we'll do console log, select all from posts
 * 
 * And under "author" we'll do console log, select all from users
 * where id = post.author_id
 * 
 * If we run our request again, we can see that we're only making
 * one database request to fetch the list of posts
 * 
 * But we're also making individual requests for the author on each post
 * Including several requests for the same author
 * 
 * At the end of this series, we'll show how to use Data Loaders
 * for caching and batching database operations so that we can 
 * serve all of these results with only one database request
